## Conclusion
The Power BI dashboard highlights key sales trends, revealing that smaller cities contribute significantly to overall revenue. Supermarkets play a dominant role in sales, while grocery stores generate comparatively lower revenue. Customer preference leans toward regular-fat products, with certain product categories consistently outperforming others. Over time, sales have shown fluctuations, peaking at a certain point before experiencing a decline. Improving customer ratings and enhancing product visibility, especially in larger outlets, could further drive sales. To maintain growth, the business should focus on expanding in high-performing locations, optimizing inventory based on demand, and enhancing customer satisfaction strategies.
